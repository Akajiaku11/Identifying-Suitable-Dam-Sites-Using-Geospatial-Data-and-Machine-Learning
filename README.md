# Identifying Suitable Dam Sites Using Geospatial Data and Machine Learning

## Overview
This study presents a comprehensive approach to identifying optimal dam sites along the Katsina-Ala River in Benue State, Nigeria, by integrating **Geospatial Data** and **Machine Learning** with Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The methodology combines advanced geospatial analysis tools, machine learning algorithms, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine suitable locations for dam infrastructure.

## Objective
The primary goal of this study is to develop a **robust decision-making tool** for selecting suitable dam sites based on environmental, topographic, and hydrological criteria, ensuring sustainable water resource management and infrastructure development.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration:** Utilization of diverse geospatial datasets:
  - **Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM** for elevation and slope data.
  - **Sentinel-2 Imagery** for land use/land cover classification.
  - **General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)** for bathymetric insights.
  - **Historical Rainfall Data** for hydrological analysis.
- **Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA):** Assigning weights to suitability criteria using the **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**.
- **Machine Learning:** Validation of suitability results using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier.
- **Geospatial Analysis Tools:** Use of **ArcGIS 10.5** and Python-based machine learning algorithms.

## Methodology
The approach integrates the following steps:
1. **Data Acquisition:** Collection of geospatial data (DEM, Sentinel-2 imagery, GEBCO, and rainfall data).
2. **Pre-Processing:** Preparing and analyzing datasets in ArcGIS and Python environments.
3. **Criteria Selection:** Identification of influencing factors:
   - **Elevation**
   - **Stream Order**
   - **Slope**
   - **Distance from Stream**
   - **Land Use/Land Cover (LULC)**
   - **Rainfall**
   - **Soil**
   - **Geology**
4. **Weight Assignment:** Prioritization of criteria using the AHP method:
   - **Stream Order (34%)** and **Slope (21%)** are given higher weights due to their importance.
5. **Suitability Analysis:** Integration of weighted factors to generate the final suitability map.
6. **Model Validation:** Using SVM classification and expert reviews to confirm the model's robustness.

## Results
- **Identified Sites:** Two proposed sites, **KA1** and **KA2**, were determined to be the most suitable dam locations based on the following conditions:
  - **Lower Elevations**: 108–151 meters.
  - **Flat Slopes**.
  - **Proximity to Streams**: ≤ 300 meters.
  - **High Rainfall**: 218–224 mm.
- **Validation Results:** The suitability model achieved **over 80% accuracy** when compared to SVM classifications and expert reviews.
- **Final Suitability Map:** A practical decision-making tool for dam construction projects.

## Tools & Technologies
- **ArcGIS 10.5**: Geospatial data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: Machine learning implementation and data processing.
- **AHP**: Weight assignment for MCDA.
